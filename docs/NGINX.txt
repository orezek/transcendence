Pooling Mechanism in NGINX
NGINX uses an event-driven, asynchronous, and non-blocking architecture to handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently. Its pooling mechanism relies on:

Worker Processes: NGINX spawns one or more worker processes, each capable of handling thousands of connections.
Connection Pooling: Each worker uses an event loop with efficient mechanisms like:
epoll on Linux.
kqueue on FreeBSD/macOS.
select or poll as fallbacks.
Connections are pooled in the worker's event loop, minimizing overhead for creating and destroying connections repeatedly.
